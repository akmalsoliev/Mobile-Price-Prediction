Steps: 
* Feature and target correlation and importance;
* Data scaling to reduce the computation time and weight;
* Dimensionality reduction and its effect;
* Application of different models and its effect on our train and test dataset; 
* Analyzing the effectivness of the model via metrics. 

Main files: 
* `Mobile Price Prediction.ipynb` - jupyter-notebook interactive file that can be used to reproduce the findings.
* `Mobile Price Prediction.pdf` - PDF file to view the results. 

The dataset is provided by Abhishek Sharma from 'Mobile Price Classification' on Kaggle.
